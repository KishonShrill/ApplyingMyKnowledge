## My process

I used flexbox because it is an easy way to center containers and images on the screen (Not because I haven't mastered grid yet ðŸ¥¹) then on the mobile version, used object-fit to crop the image to the desired height and weight without stretching the image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned that an easy way to crop an image is by using the object-fit property in css. Learned that the hard way and had to browse for an hour to find the correct solution to surfing in StackOverflow to arriving in [The answer to my problem](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit)

```css
.card img {
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0px 0px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [developer.mozilla.org - object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - This helped me in cropping the image.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helped me remember the syntax and markup to use in html and css.
