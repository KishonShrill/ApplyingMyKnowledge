<h3>Just Trying Out</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm just a student at MSU-IIT trying to explore, implement, and apply all my knowledge I have acquired. The purpose why I have done this is because... welps... It's fun, and for a student like me who is new to this kind of environment such as coding, programming, logic, and crying over words on code about why it won't work and why it works hehe...</p>

<h3>Added Notes</h3>
<p>Anyways, I update my content once in a while when I'm bored or when I have time to do stuff like after chores or after doing my assignments...</p>

<p>If you want to contact me via email, message me at <a href="mailto:chriscentlouisjune.pingol@g.msuiit.edu.ph">chriscentlouisjune.pingol@g.msuiit.edu.ph</a>.</p>
